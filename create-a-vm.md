# **Create a VM lab**

## **My first VM**
### **1. What OS if your VM running?**
 - Windows 10 Home

### **2. What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?**
 - The VM failed to run the first few times. I had to download VMware fusion to assist in this.
 - After downloading VMware, I was able to turn on virtualization which allowed me to run my VM with no other issues.

### **3. How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? Why did you choose these amounts?**

 - I allocated 2048 mb of RAM and 32gb of hard disk space to my VM.
 - Since my laptop only has 8gb of RAM, I decided to allocate the minimum amount to not use up all of my RAM space.
 - Using too much RAM can significantly degrade the host machine's performance by taking up too much space.
 - My hard disk has 500gb total that I can use so I went with 32gb to allocate to hard disk space.

### **4. What settings did you change and why?**
 - I enabled 3D acceleration and allocated the maximum amount of video memory which was 256mb

### **5. How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings?**
 - Before enabling 3D acceleration, the vm was quite laggy and objects did not move instantaneously with my cursor.
 - After enabling the 3D feature, my vm felt more smooth to operate with the moving parts.

### **6. What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance?**
 - Having a high internet speed will definitely be important in working with a vm. I tested out YouTube and it did not load within the first 3 minutes.
 - Using more RAM will also opitmize a vm's perfomance by allowing it to run multiple applications more seamlessly. 


## Your second VM - Ubuntu

### **1. What OS if your VM running?**
- Ubuntu 24.04

### **2. What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?**
- when booting up the Ubuntu VM, it gave me an error message when clicking "Try or install Ubuntu" so I resorted to the next best option which is "Ubuntu Safe Mode."
- that option seemed to work for me without any error messages

### **3. How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? Why did you choose these amounts?**

 - I allocated 2048 mb of RAM and 25gb of hard disk space to my VM.
 - Since my laptop only has 8gb of RAM, I decided to allocate the minimum amount to not use up all of my RAM space.
 - Using too much RAM can significantly degrade the host machine's performance by taking up too much space.
 - My hard disk has 500gb total that I can use so I went with 25gb to allocate to hard disk space.
- Ubuntu requires less memory and hard disk space compared to the Windows VM

### **4. What settings did you change and why?**
 - I enabled 3D acceleration and allocated the maximum amount of video memory which was 256mb
 - I enabled bidrectional mode which allowed me to copy and paste between the host and VM

### **5. How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings?**
 - Before enabling 3D acceleration, the vm was quite laggy and objects did not move instantaneously with my cursor.
 - After enabling the 3D feature, my vm felt more smooth to operate with the moving parts.
 - Bidrectional mode is necessary so that I can quickly copy and paste files between my host and VM

### **6. What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VM’s performance?**
 - Having a high internet speed will definitely be important in working with a vm.
 - Using more RAM will also opitmize a vm's perfomance by allowing it to run multiple applications more seamlessly.
 - More customization options would be beneficial to the user as well to suit their personal needs.
